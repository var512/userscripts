# userscripts

My personal [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript). Install from [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/var512) or [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/users/222767-var512).

🔁 Loop video files
------
Sets the loop attribute when viewing video files in their own window/tab. Certain userscript extensions requires `document-start` to work.

▶️ YouTube - Channel redirector
------
Redirects the channel from featured to videos tab. Only for direct URL access, links are not replaced and events are not observed. Mainly used for when entering YouTube channels from social media or external links.
