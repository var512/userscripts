# userscripts

My personal [userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript).

🔁 Loop video files
------
Sets the loop attribute when viewing video files in their own window/tab. Certain userscript extensions requires `document-start` to work.

▶️ YouTube - Channel redirector
------
Redirects a channel to the videos tab. Links are not replaced and events are not observed. Mainly used for when entering YouTube channels from social media or external links.
